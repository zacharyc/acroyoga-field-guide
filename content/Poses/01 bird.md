# Bird

This is usually the first pose ever learned in Acroyoga.

## Front Plank

This is the first step into the world of birds. It's a supported version of regular bird.

In this pose the flyer is roughly parallel with the ground and the base is lying on the ground in a L shape. The flyers hands and the bases hands are connected and aimed through the bases shoulders.

Hand Grips

The Base allows the flyer to fall into the feet by bringing the need towards the elbows. When the hands make contact, the base pushes through the heels of the flyer to parallel with the ground. Depending on base and flyer proportions, the flyer can arch into a small cobra in the back to make the line between shoulders perpendicular to the ground.

To dismount the base lowers the knees to the shoulders while keeping the arms straight. Once the flyer makes contact with the ground the base extends the flyer by pushing through the toes to get the flyer to perpendicular with the ground.
