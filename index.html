      <h1>Acroyoga Field Guide</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Acroyoga Field Guide. This is an attempt to create a resource for figuring out what to do a jam.
        This guide is not complete and there are many people who are far more expert than me. No written word can be
        substitute for a good instructor. Hopefully this is just a starting off point.</p>
