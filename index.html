      <h1>Acroyoga Field Guide</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Acroyoga Field Guide. This is an attempt to create a
        resource for figuring out what to do a jam. This guide is not complete
        and there are many people who are far more expert than me. No written
        word can be substitute for a good instructor. Hopefully this is just a
        starting off point.

        This book / site was made by zacharyc with the guidance of many, many,
        many wonderful instructors and friends who have helped me learn the
        skills to be write this.

        The site and book is made via 11ty. Much of the knowledge is written
        originally in Obsidian and then moved over to this website. Eventually
        this will be a hard copy, but that is going to be a while. Updates to
        how that is produced, once itâ€™s made, will be posted here (hopefully).
        The content on this site can be referenced however you would like, but
        an attribution would be greatly appreciated.
