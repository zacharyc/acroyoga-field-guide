<p>Firstly, thanks for picking up a copy (or reading it online) of this

field. It is a guide with some ideas of what to practice. This guide is

especially something rated difficult, please find an expert to help you
out. This guide is more meant to refresh your memory and give you ideas
of what to put together.</p>

<h2 id="poses">Poses</h2>
<h3 id="grips">Grips</h3>
<h4 id="bird-grip">Bird Grip</h4>
<p>This is a grip for doing bird.</p>
<p><strong>Flyers Fingers Forwards</strong> is the alliteration you need
to remember for this grip.</p>
<p>Both the flyer and base have mitton hands where the fingers are all
together and the thumb is out to the side (perpendicular). The
alliteration above is super helpful. The flyers fingers face forwards
and so the bases fingers need to face to the outside to fit in.</p>
<h4 id="hand-to-hand-grip">Hand to Hand Grip</h4>
<p>This grip is used for doing hand to hand and other poses like star.
For some reason it’s known as hand to hand grip. It is also sometimes
known as peace grip.</p>
<p>In this grip, both partners shoot two fingers down the wrist. Thumbs
lock and the other two fingers wrap the hand. The goal is to compress
the space between the palms.</p>
<h4 id="bro-grip-butterfly-grip">Bro Grip / Butterfly Grip</h4>
<p>This is a grip where each person extends the same sided hand.
Interlock the thumbs and rap the rest of the fingers around the backside
of the palm.</p>
<p>This grip is used mostly for a thing called courtesy. Helping people
up and down to the ground.</p>
<h3 id="l-base">L-Base</h3>
<h4 id="all-the-birds">All The Birds</h4>
<p>The most common pose in Acro is called Bird. It’s like that pose
Airplane you used to do when you were a kid, but without the hands. This
section will deal with the all the birds and there are bunch of
them.</p>
<h5 id="front-plank">Front Plank</h5>
<p>This is the first step into the world of birds. It’s a supported
version of regular bird.</p>
<p>In this pose the flyer is roughly parallel with the ground and the
base is lying on the ground in a L shape. The flyers hands and the bases
hands are connected and aimed through the bases shoulders.</p>
<p><a href="#grips">Grips</a></p>
<p>The Base allows the flyer to fall into the feet by bringing the need
towards the elbows. When the hands make contact, the base pushes through
the heels of the flyer to parallel with the ground. Depending on base
and flyer proportions, the flyer can arch into a small cobra in the back
to make the line between shoulders perpendicular to the ground.</p>
<p>To dismount the base lowers the knees to the shoulders while keeping
the arms straight. Once the flyer makes contact with the ground the base
extends the flyer by pushing through the toes to get the flyer to
perpendicular with the ground.</p>
<h6 id="bird">Bird</h6>
<p>Bird is front Plank without the hands.</p>
<p>It is achieved by the base putting more pressure on the toes, like
stepping on a gas peddle. This motion is attempting to help the flyer
lift the chest up.</p>
<p>Flyers can help by pushing more into the hips. And pulling the heels
and chest up towards the sky.</p>

<p>This book / site was made by <a
href="https://www.zacharyc.com">zacharyc</a> with the guidance of many,
many, many wonderful instructors and friends who have helped me learn
the skills to be write this.</p>
<p>The site and book is made via Pandoc. Much of the knowledge is
written originally in Obsidian and then moved over to this website.</p>
<p>Eventually this will be a hard copy, but that is going to be a while.
Updates to how that is produced, once it’s made, will be posted here
(hopefully).</p>
