# Introduction

Firstly, thanks for picking up a copy (or reading it online) of this
field guide. It is a project that I felt I needed to do and hopefully
you will find it useful. I’m writing this as much for me as I am for
you, but if you have feedback, don’t hesitate to send me a note at
<a href="mailto:zachary@zacharyc.com">zachary@zacharyc.com</a>.

This guide is designed to be a tool for someone doing acroyoga in the
field. It is a guide with some ideas of what to practice. This guide
is NOT a replacement for instruction. If you are trying something new,
especially something rated difficult, please find an expert to help
you out. This guide is more meant to refresh your memory and give you
ideas of what to put together.
