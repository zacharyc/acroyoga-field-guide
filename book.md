## Introduction {#intro}

Firstly, thanks for picking up a copy (or reading it online) of this field guide. It is a project that I felt I needed to do and hopefully you will find it useful. I'm writing this as much for me as I am for you, but if you have feedback, don't hesitate to send me a note at zachary@zacharyc.com.

This guide is designed to be a tool for someone doing acroyoga in the field. It is a guide with some ideas of what to practice. This guide is NOT a replacement for instruction. If you are trying something new, especially something rated difficult, please find an expert to help you out. This guide is more meant to refresh your memory and give you ideas of what to put together.

## Poses

### L-Base

#### All The Birds

The most common pose in Acro is called Bird. It's like that pose Airplane you used to do when you were a kid, but without the hands. This section will deal with the all the birds and there are bunch of them.

##### Front Plank

This is the first step into the world of birds. It's a supported version of regular bird.

In this pose the flyer is roughly parallel with the ground and the base is lying on the ground in a L shape. The flyers hands and the bases hands are connected and aimed through the bases shoulders.

[[Hand Grips]]

The Base allows the flyer to fall into the feet by bringing the need towards the elbows. When the hands make contact, the base pushes through the heels of the flyer to parallel with the ground. Depending on base and flyer proportions, the flyer can arch into a small cobra in the back to make the line between shoulders perpendicular to the ground.

To dismount the base lowers the knees to the shoulders while keeping the arms straight. Once the flyer makes contact with the ground the base extends the flyer by pushing through the toes to get the flyer to perpendicular with the ground.

###### Bird

Bird is front Plank without the hands.

It is achieved by the base putting more pressure on the toes, like stepping on a gas peddle. This motion is attempting to help the flyer lift the chest up.

Flyers can help by pushing more into the hips. And pulling the heels and chest up towards the sky.
